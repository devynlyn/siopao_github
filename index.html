      <h2>what i do</h2>
      <p> i am a bit of a jack-of-all-trades having worked everything from retail
        jobs to technician and admin roles, fast food to homecare, carpet cleaning
        to ice cream making, hotel front desk clerk to teacher.
        <br /><br /> aside from all of these roles, my very favorite roled are <thead>
        ones where i get to show my creative side. i've been a graphic designer for
        over 12 years and i also enjoy photography and videography. i've recently
        gotten into coding and web design and eventually hope to be a one-stop-shop
        for small businesses to setup their branding and marketing as well as offer
        my services on an individual basis.
        <br /><br /> in the future i hope to own a cafe that doubles as a work space
        for students and fellow freelancers. i plan to do my freelance work there
        as well as create what's on the menu. :P
